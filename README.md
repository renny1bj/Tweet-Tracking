## Topic: Data-based automatic Covid-19 rumors detection in social networks

Social media is one of the largest sources of propagating information, however, it is also
a home ground for rumors and misinformation. The recent extraordinary event in 2019,
the COVID-19 global pandemic, has spurred a web of misinformation due to its sudden
rise and global widespread. False rumors can be very dangerous because it causes
confusion and possible health threat, therefore, there is a need to tackle the problem
of detecting and mitigating false rumors. In this paper, we propose a framework to
automatically detect rumor on the individual and network level. This framework
makes use of text and image analysis to extract and rank rumor candidates with a
real-time component. We extracted signal tweets from a subset of data from Twitter.
We used verification and corrections tweets, fake images users share on social media
platforms with the intent to deceive the public, World Health Organizationâ€™s COVID-19
Mythbusters, and known false news websites published on Wikipedia. We analyzed a
large dataset to evaluate different machine learning models and extract the top features
of the best model that have a great impact on the truth value. We discover that 90
percent of the top ten tweets ranked by the cat boost model was real rumors, and image
analysis also contributes to the precision score but at the expense of higher runtime.
The results contributed greatly to the classification of individual tweets as the dataset
for the classification task were updated continuously, thereby increasing the number of
training examples hourly.
The web application is dynamic. Below are the screenshots of the web app.
